      <p class="lead"><a href="/">Open Infrastructure Map</a> is a view of the world's hidden infrastructure mapped in the
      <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap database</a>.</p>
      <p>By and large, this data isn't exposed on the main OSM map, so I built
        Open Infrastructure Map to visualise it.</p>

      <h2>How do I contribute?</h2>
      <p>If you want to edit the data and you're new to OpenStreetMap, check out
      <a href="https://learnosm.org">learnOSM.</a></p>
      <p>
          If you already have some OSM experience and want to start tagging infrastructure things,
          take a look at the tagging guidelines for
          <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Power">power</a> and <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Telecoms">WikiProject Telecoms</a>.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Underground networks safety</h2>
      <p>Any underground facility or network maybe vulnerable to digging machinery used during adjacent civil works.
      <br/>Many countries took legal measures to limit risks and impacts of accidents. In practice, it often consists in prior declaration and linking to concerned networks operator in the immediate area to get official and up to date cartography.
      <br/>This website and contributors can't be liable to any damage caused consecutively of the use of data to plan upcoming work on ground. You're still responsible to achieve regulatory tasks and our data won't help you to do so.
      <br/>Keep in mind this data is provided as this without any guarentee. You won't be able to set up works in immediate proximity of underground networks with the help of this map.</p>

      <h2>How is OIM made?</h2>
      <p>The following mess of tools and services make Open Infrastructure Map run:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a>/<a href="http://postgis.net/">PostGIS</a> for data storage
        <li><a href="https://imposm.org/">Imposm3</a> for filtering and importing the OSM data
        <li><a href="http://tegola.io/">Tegola</a> for vector tile rendering and serving
	<li>The <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/">Mapbox GL JS</a> web interface</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The background map data is kindly provided by <a href="https://www.maptiler.com/"><img width="150px" src="img/maptiler.png"></a>.</p>

      <h2>Where's the code?</h2>
      <p>You can find some bits of OIM on the
          <a href="https://github.com/openinframap/">openinframap Github organisation</a>.
          More to come, soon.</p>

      <h2>Who made this?</h2>
      <p>I'm <a href="https://russ.garrett.co.uk">Russ</a>, and I like infrastructure.
         Please don't contact me about copyright claims or similar, these should properly
         be directed <a href="https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Takedown_procedure">to
	 OpenStreetMap</a>.</p>

      <h2>Support OpenInfraMap</h2>
	<p>OpenInfraMap is a personal side project which costs me around $1200/year to run. If you like
	   OpenInfraMap, you can chip in to help with these costs on Liberapay: <script src="https://liberapay.com/russss/widgets/button.js"></script>
           <noscript><a href="https://liberapay.com/russss/donate"><img alt="Donate using Liberapay" src="https://liberapay.com/assets/widgets/donate.svg"></a></noscript>
	</p>

      <h2>How do I access the data?</h2>
      <p>All the data currently displayed on OpenInfraMap is sourced directly from OpenStreetMap.</p>

      <p>If you can consume vector data in Mapbox Vector Tiles format, you can fetch vector data directly
	 from the OpenInfraMap tile server using the <a href="/map.json">TileJSON file</a>.</p>

      <p>If you need relatively small extracts of data, you can use
	 <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/">Overpass Turbo</a> to generate these in GeoJSON and
	 similar formats.</p>

      <p>For larger amounts of data, you will need to fetch and process the raw OSM data directly,
	 which is relatively complex.</p>

      <p>I can provide exports from the OpenInfraMap database, for which I charge a fee of
	 £85 to cover my time. More complex work will normally be billed at £100/hour although I am
         happy to negotiate this based on the task. Please contact
	 <a href="mailto:russ@garrett.co.uk">russ@garrett.co.uk</a> if you are interested in this.</p>

      <p>If you use this data, you will need to comply with the
          <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap licensing terms</a>, which
          require that you attribute OpenStreetMap. Attribution of "OpenInfraMap", and a link to this
          website, would be appreciated but is not required.
